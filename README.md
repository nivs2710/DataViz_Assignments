Assignment 1 - 21st April
Individual Project: Data Product Redesign - Submission 1

The author through this article is trying to communicate how amongst all other developed countries, America stands out in terms of gun violence. He uses 17 charts to build this context and tries to establish a connection between increased gun violence and ease of firearms access to people

**The problem statement: 

•	To set a context by showing that gun violence is way higher in America as compared to all the other developed countries
•	To assess the impact of liberal gun laws or people’s easy access to firearms to increased gun violence

**Ineffectiveness of the data product:

The data product talks about several types of gun violence: homicides, suicides, mass shootings (relating to death or just wounded), and every graph talks about one of these aspects separately. A comprehensive picture of total gun violence in the US vs other countries has not been shown.
The graphs are not arranged in a logical order that really tells the complete story.

There are some ambiguities like:
-	Graph 8: Definition of tighter gun control laws is not clear
-	Graph 3: The graph doesn’t support the title or the content in the paragraph. There is no timeline vs mass shooting data or graph that represents the title
-	Graph 7: The graph is not very effective in communicating the actual comparison between countries. For e.g. Violent Crime % to the total crime within each country will help us assess the situation better. 
Also, the graph just shows the rates, but not base line numbers for comparison.
-	Graph 17 – It is not clear from the graph as to what Rep/Lean Rep or Dem/ Lean Dem stands for, hence it is difficult to understand if a wider gap is favorable or not
The relevance of graph 14 and 15 i.e. higher police officer death and support for gun ownership to the main problem statement is not very clear. The graphs or the article does not really connect the dots.

**Data product redesign:

I would consider homicides, suicides and mass shootings as three separate categories and try to identify the impact of liberal gun laws/ ownership in each.

A.	To establish the fact that US ranks lower in terms of violence/crime related deaths in general but has an exceptionally high comparative count of gun violence deaths:

1.	Comparisons of total deaths due to violence in US Vs other developed countries. 
2.	Bifurcation of these deaths by category (one of it would be gun violence) and give a comparison amongst various countries
3.	Year on year comparison to show trends in gun violence and other violence related deaths (if there is enough data)


B.	To establish a positive correlation between level of gun ownership vs gun violence rate:

4.	Comparison of gun ownership vs gun violence in each country
5.	Year on year rate of change in gun ownership vs rate of change in gun violence (if there is enough data)
6.	We also need to quantify the gun laws and try to see the change in these rules over years (if possible). Also assess the impact of these rule changes on gun violence in totality and on various categories

C.	Once this correlation is established, we may try to understand trends in various gun violence categories i.e. homicides, suicides and mass shootings and correlate each with the level of gun ownership

7.	Year on year % change in the number of deaths in each category compared to change of rate of gun ownership
8.	We may also breakdown this analysis state-wise to understand if each state has a different trend
9.	Consider other factors affecting homicides, suicides and mass shootings

Once, I establish that liberal gun ownership laws is correlated to higher gun violence, I will also see if I can establish a causality relation between the two. If I am successful in doing that, then I would move on to consider the viable solutions to curb ease of firearm access. One of the proposed solutions could be bringing about a change in the gun ownership law. I would then further assess the reasons why it has been so difficult to change the same, like people’s support, political reasons, etc. through various graphs.

**Potential starting points for a deceptive version:

1.	Graph 9: By changing the measurement metric from per 100,000 people to per 100 people, we can potentially induce a visual deception that the rate of firearm homicide deaths has not decreased substantially.
2.	Graph 11 & 14: It is potentially deceptive, since we do not know the composition of states within the each of the categories i.e. highest and lowest rates of gun ownership 

**Possible DataSources that I may use:
